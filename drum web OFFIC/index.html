        <h1> HOW TO BE A GOOD DRUMMER</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="p1-intro">
        <p> Becoming a good drummer isn't something that happens in one day or something that's achivable over a night.
            Becoming a good drummer takes alot of practice and you got to have that urge and passion for music.
             Over the years i tried to find methods which could help me become a good drummer and a better web designer and a web developer.
            I'm sure you heard the words "practice makes perfect" indeed practising regulary makes you perfect in whatever you are doing.
            Let's dive into the steps below on how to become a good drummer. 
         </p>

    <h3><div class="step1"> STEP 1: </div>  <div class="h3"> DEVELOP  MUSCLE  MEMORY </h3> </div>
    <div class="step1imaged">

    <div class="p1">
        <p> This might sound like you need to hit the gym! but the truth is that being musclear doesn't necessary means that you can play drumms better,
            Having big biceps and triceps just puts a small advantage on your drumming speed and techinique. 
            Muscle memory is real but it's not what you probally think it is in this case.
            Muscle memory is a form of procedural memory that involves consolidating a specific motor task into memory through repetition. Doing your rudiments everyday
            this gets registered into your brain. It means rehearsing (correctly repeating) a physical action until it becomes a habit that no longer requires your mind.
             It allows you to execute grooves, fills, rhythms, and other musical patterns while you use your attention for important things such as listening to other musicians you're playing with.

    <h3> <div class="step2"> STEP 2: </div> <div class="h3-2"> LEARN HOW TO  KEEP  TIME  </h3> </div>

    <div class="p2">
        <p>
            Learning to keep time as a drummer it took me couple of months, to just be able to follow that "click track"
            I highly recormend Metronome for this step, specially if you know that you suck at timing or you keep on loosing your tempo well you busy playing in church or at a gig.
            The best way to develop time, is counting "1,2,3,4" well you playing a simple beat such as 1/4 or 4/4.
            Yes. You have to count, and you have to know the other musician's parts in order to get transitions right.
            You have to know your time signatures and the subdivisions and count it out. There are tricks though: Standard rock rhythms have kick on 1 and 3 and snare on 2 and 4.
            So if you are playing that, you don't have to count every note. You could count 1 and 3 for example. Generally speaking though, you have to count and understand time.
         </p>
    </div>
    <h3> <div class="step3"> STEP 3: </div>  <div class="h3-3"> LEARN HOW TO WORK  WITH  OTHERS  </h3> </div>
    <div class="step3imaged">
        <img src="step3image.png" width="420" height="290">
    </div>

    <div class="p3">
        <p> As a musician you need to be able to work with others, specially if you are a drummer. other musicans such the Keyboadist and 
            guitarist, this two can work independetly only if they can really sing.
            You as a drummer yo need to learn how to work with other band members even thou you are the "MAIN O"
            You need to learn how to fit in with other musicians so that you can produce good music for the audience.
            our band mates can help you improve as an individual. On stage, they can lock in with you and make suggestions to help you improve. 
            Try bouncing ideas around with your band mates. This creates a fun dynamic.
            Your band members can also give you valuable feedback that can help you become a better drummer. 
            If you’re not in a band, you can still learn how to work with others. Your teacher is a great resource to provide feedback and suggestions to help you improve. 
            If you have friends who are musicians, ask them to listen to you play, they may have some great tips to help you get better.

    <h3> <div class="step4">STEP 4: </div>  <div class="h3-4">USE  VIDEOS </h3> </div>
    <div class="step4imaged">

    </div>
    
    <div class="p4"> 
      <p> Using YouTube videos might sound like you coping someone's work but trust me you not, because the whole reason why drummmers like Jared Folk posts videos of themselves playing or
          giving drumming lessons is so that the upcoming drummers can have a platform where they can find inspiration and space to improve.
          I remember the first time i searched on YouTube " what is rudiments?" i was shocked by how many videos are there all focusing on one topic.
          So don't feel guilty or nerves when you find yourself playing Eric Moore's chops during your saturday gig.
          watching people who are bettr than you on YouTube or Live , it gives you courge and keeps your passinate burning.
          we  humans learn alot from others

    <h3> <div class="step5">STEP 5:</div>  <div class="h3-5"> START  SLOW </h3> </div>
    <div class="step5imaged">
        <img src="step5img.png" width="450" height="240">
    </div>

    <div class="p5">
        <p> <Q> <i>PATIENCE IS THE KEY</i></Q> <small>- <b>said eveyone</b></small> ; indeed being patience with yourself helps you to take things slow.
          This step is very important because myself i have seen many drummer who started playing drums and they decided to jump from level 1 to level 20.
          Skipping makes you look really unprofessional because this means that you can only play curtain style or curtain music.
          I have so much friends that can only play one type of music, if you give them a song thats on 3/8 they gonna do wonders!
          That's why i recommend take your time and make sure you don't skip because the moment you skip, than somewhere somehow you will meat a song that's gonna give you headache because you skipped.
          Start slowly doing your paraddidles and your singles,doubles and then you move to your flams etc... 
         </P>

    <h3> <dic class="step6"> STEP 6: </dic> <div class="h3-6"> MASTER  THE  BASICS  BEFORE  YOU  DEVELOP  YOUR  STYLE </h3> </div>
    <div class="step6imaged">
        <img src="step6image2.png" width="400" height="250">
    </div>

    <div class="p6">
        <p>     Step 5 and this step goes hand-inhand because when you start slow you are doing the basics that you know.
                Master each and every basics about drums Example of few basics : 
    <div class="ol">
                <ol> Names Of The Different Types Cymbals </ol>
                <ol> Different Types Of Drums</ol> 
                <ol>How To Set Up a Drum Kit</ol> 
                <ol> How To Tune Drums</ol>
                <ol> Different Types Of Drumm Sticks</ol>  
                <ol> How Do You Like Your Drum To Sound Like </ol>
                <ol>What's A Parraddile, What Are Singles, Doubles and Tripples</ol>
                Besides knwoing the above, mastering the basics includes alot of things; Mastering the "basic level" that's the first level of mastering the basics.
                The most common mistake that we drummers make is wanting to play only one type of Genre, in my opinion it's a wrong move because if you aiming for the big fish you must know how to play more than 4 genres the minimimum.

    <h3> <div class="step7">STEP 7: </div> <div class="h3-7"> DEVELOP  BOTH  HANDS </h3> </div>
    <div class="step7imaged">
        <img src="step7img2.png" width="200" height="200">
    </div>

    <div class="p7">
       <p> At this point if you been drumming for less than a year you might have noticed that you right hand is more active or much faster than your left hand.
            Don't worry or  panic because this totaly normal, its natural. 
            I don't know if you have seen it but people who are left handed are much faster on drums compared to a person who is right handed. 
            This is also normal because we humans we are all different in our own ways.
            The secret behind hand speed is <i> Drumming Pad </i> when you have a drumming Pad or a practing Pad you hand speed starts to improve as the days goes by only if you put effort and time into your practice.
            The first week after i got a drumming pad from my best friend, i seached on YouTube how "How to develop hand speed using  a practising pad?"
            To tell you the truth 87% of the videos on YouTube that talked about this topic, they all focused on a practing pad.
            The only thing you need is cheat sheet that's full of all different types of rudiments, than practice those rudiments slowly unti you rich to 350bpm.
            Rudiments helps your hands to become one, the both do same jobs at same speed.
